 Early life:
 Abel Makkonen Tesfaye[a] was born on February 16, 1990, in Toronto, Ontario.[18] He is the only child of 
 Ethiopian immigrants Makkonen Tesfaye and Samrawit Hailu,[b] who separated shortly after his birth.[20][21] 
 He was brought up in the district of Scarborough by his mother and grandmother.[18][22] He has an estranged 
 relationship with his father, in which he explained to Rolling Stone, "I saw him vaguely when I was six, and
  then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived — I'd see 
  him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an 
  alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there."[21]

Tesfaye was raised as an Ethiopian Orthodox.[21][23] When asked whether or not he was still religious, he
 stated to Variety in 2020, "I dunno...everything is a test, and if you are religious or spiritual, you have
  to go through things."[24] His native language is Amharic, which he learned through his grandmother.[25] He
   later became fluent in French by attending a French-immersion school.[26] He was further educated at West
    Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute.[27]

When he was 17, Tesfaye dropped out of school and moved to an apartment in the neighbourhood of Parkdale with 
two friends; including his best friend and now creative director La Mar Taylor.[28] He has described this period
 as being like the 1995 film Kids "without the AIDS", as they lived a hedonistic lifestyle.[18][29] He has also
  experienced homelessness and was incarcerated on several occasions during this time, which encouraged him to 
  "smarten up, to focus."[30][31]

Tesfaye often used drugs and abused illegal substances such as ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, magic mushrooms, and
 cough syrup.[32] In December 2016, he stated that drugs were a "crutch" for him when it came to writing music.
 [33] In August 2021, during a cover story with GQ, he described himself as being "sober lite", meaning that he
  has stopped using drugs with the exception of marijuana. He also noted that he drinks alcohol occasionally,
   stating: "I'm not a heavy drinker, as much as I used to be. The romance of drinking isn't there."
